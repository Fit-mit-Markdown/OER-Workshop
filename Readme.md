## Git(Hub) Setup

Ich arbeite hier mit Tags. 

    git tag -a 1.0 -m "initial approach. good for non-oer audience intrested in project results"
    git push origin 1.0


So kann ich diese Version 1.0 immer wieder zurück erhalten. Ggf. mache ich aus dem Tag ein GitHub release, mal schauen.

Workshop (20')



## Nextcloud forked Owncloud {#nextcloud}

> In a high-profile forking earlier this year, ownCloud founder Frank Karlitschek resigned from the very company that he co-founded and forked the project he founded. In June 2016,  Karlitschek announced the fork of ownCloud, dubbed Nextcloud. Karlitschek joined hands with Spreedbox founder Niels Mache to create a new company around Nextcloud. Within 12 hours of Nextcloud announcement, ownCloud shut down its US offices due to withdrawal by their investors.

> Learning from his ownCloud mistakes, Karlitschek created a Nextcloud foundation that owns and controls the trademark on the name as well as oversees the development of the project. Nextcloud also became one of the few companies to eliminate CLAs (Contributor License Agreements).
